This package provides a script that will attempt to automate the importing of
data into FluidDB if the original data is in the json, csv and yaml formats.

It assumes the following:

- You are providing a list of items to import into FluidDB
- The "shape" of each item is the same (conforms to the same schema)

In the case of json and yaml it simply attempts to parse the raw file into a
list of python dict objects before the import takes place.

In the case of a csv file it will assume the first line is a list of headers
and that each record is the same length as the headers. This will result in a
list of python dict objects that will form the basis of the import.

Once the list of items has been abstracted into a list of Python dicts the
script will use the first item as a "template" and will create the appropriate
namespaces and tags to correspond to the keys in the dictionary.

Once this step is complete the script simply iterates over the items and
creates an object for each and tags it with the corresponding tag-values.

Example usage::

    flimp -f file.json

This will result in an interactive prompt where you supply the requested
details (such as your username and password etc...)

You'll find a log of your session in the file flimp.log. If you encounter any
problems you should look in here first.
